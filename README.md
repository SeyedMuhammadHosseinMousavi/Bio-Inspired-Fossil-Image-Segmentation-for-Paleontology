#### The code is consisted of following steps:
- 1. Evolution Strategy (ES) Histogram Equalization:
- Histogram equalization is a method in image processing of contrast adjustment using the image's histogram.
- 2. Cultural Algorithm (CA) Image Quantization:
  3. Quantization, involved in image processing, is a lossy compression technique achieved by compressing a range of values to a single quantum value. When the number of discrete symbols in a given stream is reduced, the stream becomes more compressible.
- 3. Simulated Annealing (SA) Edge Detection:
- Edge detection is used to identify points in a digital image with discontinuities, simply to say, sharp changes in the image brightness.
- 4.Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Image Segmentation:
- Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple image segments, also known as image regions or image objects.
- 5. Final Overlay
- F-Score performance metric evaluates the system VS ground truth.
