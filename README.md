%% Bio-Inspired Fossil Image Segmentation for Paleontology
%% Developed by Seyed Muhammad Hossein Mousavi between Jan to July of 2022.
% This code could be used as a tool for paleontologist.

%% The code is consisted of following steps:
% 1.Evolution Strategy (ES) Histogram Equalization
% Histogram equalization is a method in image processing of
% contrast adjustment using the image's histogram
% 2.Cultural Algorithm (CA) Image Quantization
% Quantization, involved in image processing, is a lossy compression technique
% achieved by compressing a range of values to a single quantum value.
% When the number of discrete symbols in a given stream is reduced, the 
% stream becomes more compressible.
% 3.Simulated Annealing (SA) Edge Detection
% Edge detection is used to identify points 
% in a digital image with discontinuities, simply to say, sharp changes in 
% the image brightness.
% 4.Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Image Segmentation
% Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into
% multiple image segments, also known as image regions or image objects
% 5.Final Overlay
% F-Score performance metric evaluates the system VS ground truth
% Hope this code could help you. Let's dive in =>
